# **Bilingual Handwriting Translator (English â†” Telugu) Using CycleGAN**

## **Introduction**

Handwriting is more than text â€” itâ€™s a form of visual identity that reflects language, culture, and personal style. However, most AI translation systems today focus only on converting meaning between languages (e.g., English â†’ Telugu) rather than the visual appearance of writing itself.
This creates a cultural and creative gap: there is no digital tool that can take an English handwritten word and reproduce it in the visual handwriting style of Telugu (and vice versa).

---

## **The Problem**

Designers, educators, and students currently rely on:

* Fixed, typed fonts that lack personality or cultural depth.
* Manual font creation that is time-consuming and inconsistent.
* Tools that translate words but not handwriting style, limiting creativity in bilingual or cross-script design.

---

## **Our Goal**

This project introduces a **Bilingual Handwriting Translator** powered by **CycleGAN**, a deep generative model capable of unpaired image-to-image translation.
The system learns to map the handwriting style of English and Telugu words â€” without needing paired samples â€” and then redraws any given input in the handwriting style of the target script.

By focusing on style translation instead of semantic translation, this project aims to:

* Bridge the gap between language and visual culture.
* Support creative and educational applications, such as bilingual note-taking, calligraphy design, and cultural digitization.
* Demonstrate the potential of AI in preserving handwriting diversity and cross-script artistry.

## **Project Overview**

This project implements a **CycleGAN-based architecture** for cross-lingual handwriting style transfer.
It translates the visual handwriting style of English â†” Telugu while keeping the wordâ€™s textual meaning unchanged.

The pipeline includes:

* Preprocessing and augmentation of handwriting datasets.
* CycleGAN training using unpaired English and Telugu word images.
* Integration of an **EasyOCR** module for content validation (text-fidelity check).
* A **Streamlit interface** allowing users to upload images or type text and visualize the translation interactively.


## **Installation and Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Bilingual-Handwriting-Translator.git
cd Bilingual-Handwriting-Translator
```

### **2. Create and activate your environment**

If using Conda:

```bash
conda create -n handwriting python=3.10
conda activate handwriting
```

Or with venv:

```bash
python -m venv handwriting_env
handwriting_env\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
source handwriting_env/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
```

### **3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Verify setup**

Run:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/setup.ipynb
```

You should see:

* Successful library imports
* Dataset paths verified
* Sample handwriting images displayed

## **How to Run the Notebook**

### **1. Dataset Check & Environment Test**

Open:

```
notebooks/setup.ipynb
```

This notebook:

* Loads and previews English (IAM) and Telugu (IIIT-HW) word samples
* Confirms dataset accessibility and format
* Ensures that the environment is configured correctly

### **2. Model Training**

Run:

```
notebooks/train_cycleGAN.ipynb
```

During training:

* Images are **resized to 128Ã—128**, converted to **grayscale**, and normalized to **[-1,1]**.
* **OpenCV filters** are applied dynamically for **style diversity**:

  * **Gaussian Blur:** simulates soft, cursive pen strokes.
  * **Dilation:** produces thicker or **bold** handwriting styles.
  * **Erosion:** creates lighter, finer strokes resembling **calligraphy**.
* These augmentations help the model generalize across different handwriting forms without synthetic fonts.

After training completes:

* The generated outputs are saved in `/results`.
* **EasyOCR** is applied on translated images to verify **text fidelity** (the content matches the source word).

### **3. Launch the Interactive Interface**

After training, open:

```bash
cd ui
streamlit run app.py
```

The **Streamlit app** allows users to:

* Upload or type text in English/Telugu
* Select translation direction (English â†’ Telugu or Telugu â†’ English)
* View **original**, **typed**, and **translated handwriting** side-by-side
* Display **OCR results** and **confidence score** after translation

## **Dataset Information**

### **1. IAM Handwriting Dataset (English)**

* **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ IAM Handwriting Word Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nibinv23/iam-handwriting-word-database)
* **Type:** Handwritten English word images (PNG, 300 dpi)
* **Size:** ~1.6 GB (subset of official IAM database)
* **Structure:** Flat image folder with filenames like `a01-000u-00-00.png`, `a01-000u-00-01.png`, etc.
* **Use:** Source domain for English handwriting style.

### **2. IIIT-HW Telugu Dataset (v1)**

* **Source:** [CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/iiit-indic-hw-words)
* **Type:** Telugu handwritten word images (JPG format)
* **Size:** ~3.6 GB
* **Use:** Target domain for Telugu handwriting style.
* **Folder Example:**
  `E:\datasets\IIIT_Telugu\train\writer_001\...`

### **3. Preprocessing Summary**

* Images standardized to 128Ã—128 pixels
* Grayscale normalization to [-1,1]
* **OpenCV filters** (Gaussian blur, dilation, erosion) applied *during training* for style enhancement
* Augmentation ensures balanced exposure of handwriting types across both datasets
