# Bilingual Handwriting Translator (English â†” Telugu) Using CycleGAN

## Introduction

Handwriting is more than text â€” itâ€™s a form of visual identity that reflects language, culture, and personal style. However, most AI translation systems today focus only on converting meaning between languages (e.g., English â†’ Telugu) rather than the visual appearance of writing itself.
This creates a cultural and creative gap: there is no digital tool that can take an English handwritten word and reproduce it in the visual handwriting style of Telugu (and vice versa).

### The Problem

Designers, educators, and students currently rely on:

* Fixed, typed fonts that lack personality or cultural depth.
* Manual font creation that is time-consuming and inconsistent.
* Tools that translate words but not handwriting style, limiting creativity in bilingual or cross-script design.

### Our Goal

This project introduces a **Bilingual Handwriting Translator** powered by **CycleGAN**, a deep generative model capable of unpaired image-to-image translation.
The system learns to map the handwriting style of English and Telugu words â€” without needing paired samples â€” and then redraws any given input in the handwriting style of the target script.

By focusing on style translation instead of semantic translation, this project aims to:

* Bridge the gap between language and visual culture.
* Support creative and educational applications, such as bilingual note-taking, calligraphy design, and cultural digitization.
* Demonstrate the potential of AI in preserving handwriting diversity and cross-script artistry.

## Project Overview

This project implements a CycleGAN-based architecture for cross-lingual handwriting style transfer.
It translates the visual handwriting style of English â†” Telugu while keeping the wordâ€™s textual meaning unchanged.

The pipeline includes:

* Preprocessing and augmentation of handwriting datasets.
* CycleGAN training using unpaired English and Telugu word images.
* Integration of an **EasyOCR** module for content validation (text-fidelity check).
* A **Streamlit interface** allowing users to upload images or type text and visualize the translation interactively.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Bilingual-Handwriting-Translator.git
cd Bilingual-Handwriting-Translator
```

### 2. Create and activate your environment

If using Conda:

```bash
conda create -n handwriting python=3.10
conda activate handwriting
```

Or with venv:

```bash
python -m venv handwriting_env
handwriting_env\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
source handwriting_env/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify setup

Run the setup notebook to verify environment and dataset paths:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/setup.ipynb
```

You should see:

* âœ… Environment setup complete
* âœ… Sample plots of English and Telugu handwriting images

## Dataset Information

### 1. IAM Handwriting Database (English)

* **Source:** [IAM Handwriting Database](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database)
* **Type:** Handwritten English word images (PNG, 300 dpi)
* **Size:** ~2.8 GB (115,320 word samples)
* **Structure:** Nested subfolders by writer IDs (e.g., a01, b02, â€¦)
* **Use:** Source domain for English handwriting style.

### 2. IIIT-HW Telugu Dataset (v1)

* **Source:** [CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/iiit-indic-hw-words)
* **Type:** Telugu handwritten word images (JPG format)
* **Size:** ~3.6 GB
* **Use:** Target domain for Telugu handwriting style.
* **Path Example:** `E:\datasets\IIIT_Telugu\train\writer_001\...`

### 3. Preprocessing

* Images resized to 128Ã—128, converted to grayscale, and normalized to [-1,1].
* Real-time image augmentations applied:

  * Gaussian blur
  * Dilation/Erosion
  * Brightness and contrast adjustments
  * Random rotation/cropping
* This approach preserves dataset diversity without adding synthetic font data.

## How to Run the Notebooks

### 1. Data Exploration and Environment Check

Open:

```
notebooks/setup.ipynb
```

Functions:

* Verifies dataset paths and counts
* Displays random handwriting samples
* Confirms correct environment setup

### 2. Model Training

Once verified, run:

```
notebooks/train_cycleGAN.ipynb
```

This notebook:

* Loads English and Telugu word images
* Trains the CycleGAN model for unpaired translation
* Saves checkpoints and generated results in /results

### 3. User Interface (Streamlit)

After training, launch:

```bash
cd ui
streamlit run app.py
```

The Streamlit app provides:

* Image upload or text entry options
* Direction selection (English â†’ Telugu or Telugu â†’ English)
* Visual display of:

  * Original handwriting
  * OCR-detected text
  * Generated translated handwriting
* Downloadable output and OCR match confidence score
